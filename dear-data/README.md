# dear-data

Goal: collect data and create a [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject) inspired visualization, ideally leveraging Maker Kit in some way and using [Reporter app](http://reporter-app.com/) to collect data

Progress:

as of 2021-03-01:

- have tested out the Reporter app, have found it hard to answer freeform answers consistently if I'm busy, need to crank up the frequency up reporting for things I want to track over the course of the day
- trying to think of better questions that are related to my day-to-day but are categorical instead of freeform 
- Ciera, Valeri, and I all collect the same type of data and then see the different ways we come up with for visualizing, also get to see three different "weeks-in-the-life"
